**Easily create timelines in WordPress and display achievements in a chronological way.**

Display your timelines via a Gutenberg block, via a shortcode or using the Timeline taxonomy archive page.

This plugin provides [lots of hooks](https://github.com/psaikali/wp-timeliner/wiki/Hooks) and an extensible theming system to let developers extend it and customize it.

## Philosophy
The plugin creates a new "Achievement" post type, alongside with a new "Timeline" taxonomy. 
Achievements are assigned to a timeline term, allowing them to be grouped  together on a specific timeline.

Displaying a timeline can whether be done:
- _manually_ via a Gutenberg block anywhere on your site, 
- _automatically_ via each Timeline term archive page where achievements will be displayed chronologically (disabled by default but can be enabled via plugins settings page)
